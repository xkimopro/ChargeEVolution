# Cli requirements 

The following steps need to be completed so you can use our cli.

## Navigate to the project's path

Type `cd` and the TL20-54\cli-client path.

## Pipenv activation

Type the command `pipenv sync`, which will install all the latest packages specified in the Pipfile.
Then, type the command `pipenv shell` which will activate the project's virtenv.
